# Fortune Cookie Project

## Image Setup

To display the text overlay on the holiday image:

1. Save your holiday image file as `holiday-image.png` in this directory
2. The image will be used as the background with the fortune text overlaid on top
3. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG (if using a different format, update the `src` attribute in `index.html`)

The HTML file is already configured to display the image as a background with the fortune cookie text centered on top.
